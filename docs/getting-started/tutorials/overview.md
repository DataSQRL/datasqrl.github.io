* [**Metrics Processing**](../../quickstart): Ingest and aggregate metrics data.
* [**Recommendations**](../recommendations/intro): Build a content recommendation engine based on click-stream data.

## DataSQRL Examples

The [DataSQRL Examples](https://github.com/DataSQRL/datasqrl-examples/) GitHub repository contains a number of DataSQRL projects for various use cases.
You can clone the repository to play with the examples and adjust them to your needs:
