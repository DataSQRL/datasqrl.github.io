# What is DataSQRL?

<img src="/img/generic/undraw_documentation.svg" alt="DataSQRL Documentation >" width="40%"/>

DataSQRL is an open-source data development framework for building data pipelines, event-driven microservices, and AI data products. It provides the basic structure, common patterns, and a set of tools for streamlining the development of data products. DataSQRL automates data plumbing and integrates data technologies like Apache Kafka, Flink, Postgres, DuckDB, GraphQL, and more.

DataSQRL can ingest data directly or from an external source, process the data with SQL, Java, & Python, and expose it through an API, database view, or stream to consumers.

* [Get Started](getting-started/quickstart) building with DataSQRL.
* Follow the [DataSQRL Tutorials](getting-started/tutorials/overview) for step-by-step instructions and see what you can build with DataSQRL.

## Why use DataSQRL?

- Simplified Data Engineering: Automate the integration of multiple data technologies and eliminate the "data plumbing" needed to build data pipelines.
- Runs Everywhere: DataSQRL runs in cloud environments, local servers, and even on large-scale data infrastructure.
- User-Friendly SQL Interface: Focus on what your data should do, not how it's processed. DataSQRL's SQL-based interface is accessible to beginners and powerful for experts.
